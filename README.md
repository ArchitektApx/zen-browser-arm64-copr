Automatically updated spec files and aarch64/arm64 build workflows for [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) packaged for fedora. Heavily based on the x86_64 copr repo from [sneexy](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/architektapx/zen-browser/package/zen-browser/)

If you have any issues with the package itself, feel free to report but I may not be able to fix it as this is my first time managing a package such as this. Feel free to contribute if you'd like if you can fix any issues yourself!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Note
Due to resource usage, builds are automatically made on each upstream release of zen-browser using a Github Action running on Buildjet Arm64 Runners.
All other files are only used for installing/packaging the rpm/copr.

Tried/Tested mainly on Asahi Linux,
